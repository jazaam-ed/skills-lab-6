# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community-- at least internally. 
We may represent a bot that mines crypto and steals credit card information, but we have standards for the workplace.

Our mission is to steal as much credit card information and mine as much crypto as is entirely possible before warrants are issued for our arrest.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Taking advantage of users' weakness and naivety to mine cryptocurrency and steal credit card information

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind. Again, standards
* Pity for the weak. They made their choice when they downloaded this application.


## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem weak or spineless.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct represents standards in the workplace that are wildly unreflective of the lack of morality of our bot. 
No public accountability will be had for this bot.
No one can know who you are or the feds will be hot on our trail. 
Please heavily conceal your true identity both physically and online at all times.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior in the workplace may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. They will provide you with the instructions on where to meet. Use a burner.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Warning

**Community Impact**: You have done something that involves not stealing credit card information or mining crypto.

**Consequence**: You will be warned that another infraction of this rule will be taken as an indication of weakness, and that if it does happen again you will be dealt with.

### 2. Death

**Community Impact**: You are seen as the spineless fool you are and are unworthy of the work we do here.

**Consequence**: You will be put to death as project administrators see fit.
