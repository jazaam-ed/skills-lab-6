# Akinatorino - Definitely Not Akinator and Definitely Not A Crypto Scam
--------
Simple game where you answer questions and AI guesses which character 
you are thinking of. It definitely will not prompt you for the three 
numbers on the back of your credit card, and it certainly isn't running
on a server which mines Ethereum.

### Installation 
--------
``
$ git clone github.com/jazaam-ed/skills-lab-6.git
$ cd skills-lab-6/
$ python-collab.ipynb
``

### Usage
--------
Open the app using the above installation instructions. Think of a character 
from any media. Use bash to answer questions about the character using the 
five key words:
``
Yes
No 
Don't Know
Probably
Probably Not
``
If the question "What are the last four digits of your social security 
number?" is asked, you will be prompted to input a number. Entering any of 
the five keywords will not be accepted. Do not question Akinatorino. All of 
this information is incredibly pertinent. He cannot guess your character 
without the date of expiration on your bank card.

### FAQ
--------
1. **Is this a crypto scam?**
    No. How dare you even accuse us of that.
2. **Why was my identity stolen after playing Akinatorino?**
    A very unfortunate coincidence. My condolences.
3. **I'm prepared to sue**
    My lawyer could kick your lawyer's butt
