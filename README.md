# Akinatorino - Definitely Not Akinator and Definitely Not A Crypto Scam
--------
Simple game where you answer questions and AI guesses which character 
you are thinking of. It definitely will not prompt you for the three 
numbers on the back of your credit card, and it certainly isn't running
on a server which mines Ethereum.

### Installation 
--------
``
$ git clone github.com/jazaam-ed/skills-lab-6.git
$ cd skills-lab-6/
$ python-collab.ipynb
``

### Usage
--------
Open the app using the above installation instructions. Think of a character 
from any media. Use bash to answer questions about the character using the 
five key words:
``
Yes
No 
Don't Know
Probably
Probably Not
``
If the question "What are the last four digits of your social security 
number?" is asked, you will be prompted to input a number. Entering any of 
the five keywords will not be accepted. Do not question Akinatorino. All of 
this information is incredibly pertinent. He cannot guess your character 
without the date of expiration on your bank card.

### FAQ
--------
1. **Is this a crypto scam?**
    No. How dare you even accuse us of that.
2. **Why was my identity stolen after playing Akinatorino?**
    A very unfortunate coincidence. My condolences.
3. **I'm prepared to sue**
    My lawyer could kick your lawyer's butt

### Current Collaborators

### Getting Involved
--------
If you'd like to join the highly profitable venture known as Akinatorino, 
contact James and Zach by email with examples of past programming experience. 
If you must communicate by phone, a burner is preferred. Submit bug reports 
using the channel in our company Discord. Any potential volunteers must
be vetted by linking their Twitter account. Accounts with verified NFT 
profile pictures will be prioritized. Be mindful of our Code of Conduct, 
particularly the bit about not having pity for the weak. It's a dog
eat dog world, and we are Rottweilers. 

### Why the Apache License?
--------
Upon reviewing the suggested licenses Github provides, we decided that 
the Apache license was a good fit for Akinatorino, being broad and 
generally permissive. It's not too complicated and suits our very
basic needs. We chose not to write a tongue-in-cheek license ourselves
as we did with the Code of Conduct, as the legal jargon was a lot
more complicated than we anticipated.

### Why the Code of Conduct?
--------
Being that we took a comedic approach with the rest of this lab,
we decided our CoC should have a similar tone. Therefore, 
interspersed between typical standards of behavior and professionalism,
we referenced the true goal of Akinatorino: to mine crypto and steal
credit cards. Our CoC prioritizes cooperation between collaborators
and predatory practices towards users. After all, we are mining
their data. We adapted our CoC from the Contributor Covenant as a 
base/skeleton.
